======

primer is a processor and hardware emulator, mainly for RISC platforms.

Main goal is to develop a RISC processor emulator as a concept and a particular
implementation:
   - example processor - used for debugging/testing/educational purposes
   - existing platform implementation (such as ARM platform)
   - partial hardware emulation, at least the basic stuff
